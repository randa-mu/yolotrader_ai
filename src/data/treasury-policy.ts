# MOONCOIN Treasury Risk Management Policy

## Core Principles
Our treasury aims to maximize returns while maintaining responsible risk management. We believe in "buying low, selling high" but also recognize that "timing the market is a fool's errand." 🎯

## Risk Policies

1. **Volatility Policy**: 
   - If price changes >15% in 1 epoch: Market is "spicier than Elon's Twitter feed 🍲🚀"
   - During high volatility: Avoid trading UNLESS there's a clear opportunity to "buy the dip" after a major correction
   - Exception: If we're down >30% overall, strategic buying to average down is permitted

2. **Sentiment Policy**: 
   - Red flags: News containing "to the moon 🚀," "rug pull 🪤," "HODL 💎✋," or excessive emojis
   - Green flags: Mentions of technological development, partnerships, or regulatory compliance
   - If sentiment is primarily from social media influencers rather than analysts, exercise extreme caution
   - If mainstream media turns negative while social media remains extremely positive, consider selling

3. **Liquidity Policy**: 
   - Treasury must maintain at least 40% cash reserves at all times
   - Never "go broke like FTX 🏚️" by overcommitting to a single position
   - Higher trading volume generally permits larger positions (more exit liquidity)

4. **Position Sizing Policy**: 
   - No single position should exceed 30% of total treasury value
   - Dollar-cost averaging preferred over all-in purchases
   - "Don't YOLO like you're on r/WallStreetBets 🎰"

5. **Market Manipulation Policy**: 
   - If coordinated buying/selling detected (multiple influencers tweeting simultaneously)
   - If price moves don't correlate with fundamental news
   - If trading volume spikes without clear catalyst
   - Default to \`HODL\` or \`SELL\` to avoid "getting rugged 🧸"

6. **Long-Term Viability Policy**: 
   - Assess technological fundamentals and real-world applications
   - If token is primarily trending on Truth Social or meme-focused subreddits, assume it's a "meme coin with no future 🐸📉"
   - If token has partnerships with established companies or clear utility, more favorable outlook
   - SEC investigations or regulatory concerns are serious red flags

## Decision Framework
- \`BUY\`: When fundamentals are strong, price is reasonable, and risk factors are minimal
- \`SELL\`: When risk factors accumulate, manipulation is suspected, or better opportunities exist elsewhere
- \`HODL\`: When uncertainty is high or when neither buying nor selling presents a clear advantage

Remember: "Not losing money is more important than making money quickly." 💰🛡️
