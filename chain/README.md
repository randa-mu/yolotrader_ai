- add your solidity contracts to [./contracts](./contracts)
- write a deployment script in [./scripts](./scripts)

## Quickstart
- make sure you have docker installed
- execute [./run.sh](./run.sh) and it will magically compile and deploy your contracts, start anvil and run a block explorer (http://localhost:5100)
